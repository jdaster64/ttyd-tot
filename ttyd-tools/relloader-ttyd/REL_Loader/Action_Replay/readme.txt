It should be noted that the Action Replay form of this code is significantly longer than the Gecko form. Because of this, it is recommended to use the Gecko form if possible.

It should also be noted that the decrypted form of this code will technically work as both an Action Replay code and as a Gecko code, although it is still better to use the main Gecko code.

If you must use the Action Replay form, you should be aware that it doesn't matter if you use the encrypted or decrypted form with Dolphin. If you use the encrypted form with it, then Dolphin will simply decrypt it automatically. When being used with an actual Action Replay disc, the encrypted form is required.
